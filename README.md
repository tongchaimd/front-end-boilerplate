## Basic Overview
### Packages
- Babel

  makes final javascript runnable on any browser, basically.
- Webpack
  
  is responsible for putting everything together. Starting with the entry(src/index.js), collecting all the dependencies and spitting out to dist/.
- html-webpack-plugin
  
  generates dist/index.html.
### Files & Directories
- README.md
  
  is responsible for this text you're reading.
- package.json
  
  manages npm packages and scripts(e.g. npm start).
  
- package-lock.json

  is generated when installing or changing npm packages(e.g. npm install). It keeps track of versions and dependencies of the installed packages.
- webpack.config.js

  is Webpack's configuration file.
- src/
  
  holds (almost) all the content of the application.
- dist/
  
  is generated by Webpack. It holds end products of the application.
